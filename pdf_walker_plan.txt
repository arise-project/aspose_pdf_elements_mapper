> I need to write a walker for every element in  pdf document in Aspose.pdf for Java. This parser I would use to read part of conversion. Could you start from architecture to move to deeply to details? 
ChatGPT
Certainly, I can guide you through the process of writing a walker/parser for every element in a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java. This library allows you to work with PDF documents programmatically, and in your case, you want to parse the elements within the PDF document.

Architecture:

PDF Document Loading:
The first step is to load the PDF document using Aspose.PDF. You'll need to create an instance of the com.aspose.pdf.Document class and load your PDF file into it.

Traversal and Parsing:
After loading the document, you'll traverse through its pages and elements to extract the information you need. This involves walking through the Document's structure, which can include pages, paragraphs, tables, images, and more.

Element Types:
PDF documents are made up of various types of elements such as TextFragment, Image, Table, etc. You'll need to identify these element types during traversal to handle each type accordingly.

Processing and Conversion:
Depending on what you intend to do, you might need to process and convert these elements. For example, if you're trying to convert PDF text to another format, you'll need to extract text from TextFragments and handle fonts, styles, and formatting.

Implementation Details:

Here's a high-level overview of the steps you would take to implement this:

Load PDF Document:

java
Copy code
com.aspose.pdf.Document pdfDocument = new com.aspose.pdf.Document("path_to_your_pdf.pdf");
Traversal and Parsing:

java
Copy code
for (com.aspose.pdf.Page pdfPage : pdfDocument.getPages()) {
    // Traverse through page elements
    for (com.aspose.pdf.PageItem pageItem : pdfPage.getAnnotations()) {
        // Handle page-level annotations (like links)
    }
    
    for (com.aspose.pdf.TextFragment textFragment : pdfPage.getTextFragments()) {
        // Process text fragments
        String text = textFragment.getText();
        // ... Handle font, style, etc.
    }
    
    // Traverse through other types of elements like images, tables, etc.
}

Handling Different Element Types:

Depending on the specific element type you're dealing with, you'll use different classes and methods. Aspose.PDF provides classes for each type, like TextFragment, Image, Table, etc.

Processing and Conversion:

For text extraction, you can use TextFragment.getText() method. For images, you can extract and save the images using the Image.save(String path) method.

Remember that Aspose.PDF's API may have evolved since my last knowledge update in September 2021. It's always a good idea to refer to the official documentation or any changes in the API since then.

Please consult the official Aspose.PDF for Java documentation and any accompanying examples for the most accurate and up-to-date guidance on working with PDF elements using Aspose.PDF for Java.

Show me how to walk through TextFragment, TextSegment to print test, position, font to console
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an example of how you can walk through TextFragment and TextSegment elements in a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java and print the text, position, and font information to the console:

java
Copy code
import com.aspose.pdf.*;

public class TextParsingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Load the PDF document
        com.aspose.pdf.Document pdfDocument = new com.aspose.pdf.Document("path_to_your_pdf.pdf");
        
        // Traverse through pages and text fragments
        for (com.aspose.pdf.Page pdfPage : pdfDocument.getPages()) {
            for (com.aspose.pdf.TextFragment textFragment : pdfPage.getTextFragments()) {
                System.out.println("Text: " + textFragment.getText());
                System.out.println("Position: X=" + textFragment.getPosition().getX() + ", Y=" + textFragment.getPosition().getY());
                System.out.println("Font Size: " + textFragment.getTextState().getFontSize());
                System.out.println("Font Name: " + textFragment.getTextState().getFont().getFontName());
                System.out.println("----------");
                
                // Traverse through text segments within the text fragment
                for (com.aspose.pdf.TextSegment textSegment : textFragment.getSegments()) {
                    System.out.println("Segment Text: " + textSegment.getText());
                    System.out.println("Segment Position: X=" + textSegment.getPosition().getX() + ", Y=" + textSegment.getPosition().getY());
                    System.out.println("Segment Font Size: " + textSegment.getTextState().getFontSize());
                    System.out.println("Segment Font Name: " + textSegment.getTextState().getFont().getFontName());
                    System.out.println("----------");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
In this example, replace "path_to_your_pdf.pdf" with the actual path to your PDF file.

The code iterates through each page of the PDF document, then through each TextFragment on that page. It prints the text content, position, font size, and font name for both the TextFragment and its individual TextSegment elements.

Please note that the above code assumes that the PDF document has been properly loaded and that the text and segments within the TextFragment are well-formed. If the PDF structure is complex or contains non-standard formatting, you might need to handle special cases accordingly.


does text fragment is always included in text segments?
ChatGPT
Yes, in Aspose.PDF for Java, a TextFragment is composed of one or more TextSegment elements. A TextFragment represents a continuous piece of text within a PDF document, and it can be made up of multiple TextSegment objects. Each TextSegment corresponds to a specific run of text within the TextFragment.

In most cases, a TextFragment will contain a single TextSegment that encompasses the entire text content of the fragment. However, in more complex situations, a TextFragment might be split into multiple TextSegment objects, especially if the text within the fragment has varying formatting or other attributes.

When you iterate through the TextSegment elements of a TextFragment, you're effectively breaking down the text content into smaller segments based on formatting changes or other distinctions. This allows you to handle each part of the text separately, considering its individual formatting properties.

Remember that the structure of TextFragment and TextSegment might vary depending on the complexity of the PDF document's content and formatting. Therefore, it's a good practice to account for different scenarios and adapt your code accordingly.

lets walk trought Image and print bitmap to file, position and size to console
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an example of how you can walk through Image elements in a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java, extract the images, and print their positions, sizes, and save the images to files:

java
Copy code
import com.aspose.pdf.*;

public class ImageParsingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Load the PDF document
        com.aspose.pdf.Document pdfDocument = new com.aspose.pdf.Document("path_to_your_pdf.pdf");

        int imageCount = 0;
        
        // Traverse through pages and images
        for (com.aspose.pdf.Page pdfPage : pdfDocument.getPages()) {
            for (com.aspose.pdf.Image image : pdfPage.getResources().getImages()) {
                // Get image position and size
                double x = image.getPosition().getX();
                double y = image.getPosition().getY();
                double width = image.getWidth();
                double height = image.getHeight();

                System.out.println("Image Position: X=" + x + ", Y=" + y);
                System.out.println("Image Size: Width=" + width + ", Height=" + height);
                
                // Save the image to a file
                String imageFileName = "image_" + imageCount + ".png";
                image.save(imageFileName, ImageFormat.getPng());
                System.out.println("Image saved to: " + imageFileName);

                imageCount++;
            }
        }
    }
}
In this example, replace "path_to_your_pdf.pdf" with the actual path to your PDF file.

The code iterates through each page of the PDF document and extracts images using pdfPage.getResources().getImages(). For each image, it prints the image's position, size, and saves the image as a PNG file. The images will be saved with filenames like "image_0.png", "image_1.png", and so on.

Please note that the actual image extraction and saving process might involve additional considerations, especially when dealing with different image formats and compression settings. Additionally, this example assumes that the images in the PDF document are directly accessible through the page's resources. If the images are embedded differently, you might need to adapt the code accordingly.

======


Certainly! Extracting table information and determining if there are any elements on it, along with their types and positions, involves a more intricate process compared to extracting simple text or images. Here's a general approach to achieve this using Aspose.PDF for Java:

java
Copy code
import com.aspose.pdf.*;

public class TableParsingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Load the PDF document
        com.aspose.pdf.Document pdfDocument = new com.aspose.pdf.Document("path_to_your_pdf.pdf");

        // Traverse through pages and tables
        for (com.aspose.pdf.Page pdfPage : pdfDocument.getPages()) {
            for (com.aspose.pdf.Table table : pdfPage.getTables()) {
                // Get table position and size
                double x = table.getRectangle().getLLX();
                double y = table.getRectangle().getLLY();
                double width = table.getRectangle().getWidth();
                double height = table.getRectangle().getHeight();

                System.out.println("Table Position: X=" + x + ", Y=" + y);
                System.out.println("Table Size: Width=" + width + ", Height=" + height);

                // Iterate through table rows and cells
                for (com.aspose.pdf.Row row : table.getRows()) {
                    for (com.aspose.pdf.Cell cell : row.getCells()) {
                        // Check if there are any elements in the cell
                        boolean hasElements = !cell.getParagraphs().isEmpty();
                        if (hasElements) {
                            System.out.println("Cell Position: X=" + (x + cell.getRectangle().getLLX()) + ", Y=" + (y + cell.getRectangle().getLLY()));
                            
                            // Iterate through elements in the cell
                            for (com.aspose.pdf.TextFragment textFragment : cell.getParagraphs()) {
                                System.out.println("Text in Cell: " + textFragment.getText());
                                // Handle text formatting, font, etc.
                            }
                            // You can also check for other element types like images, etc.
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
In this example, replace "path_to_your_pdf.pdf" with the actual path to your PDF file.

The code iterates through each page of the PDF document and extracts tables using pdfPage.getTables(). For each table, it prints the table's position and size. Then, it iterates through each row and cell in the table, checking if there are any elements (text, images, etc.) within each cell. If there are elements, it prints their positions.

Please note that dealing with elements within cells requires iterating through each cell's paragraphs and analyzing the contained elements, which could be text fragments, images, etc. The example focuses on text fragments within cells, but you can extend it to handle other element types as well.

Keep in mind that PDF structure and formatting can be complex, and this example assumes a relatively simple scenario. You may need to adjust the code to handle various table layouts, cell nesting, and different types of elements more effectively.

==========

Certainly! Here's how you can walk through different types of annotations in a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java, extract their positions, page numbers, and related information (text, links, stamps), and save their resources to files:

java
Copy code
import com.aspose.pdf.*;

public class AnnotationParsingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Load the PDF document
        com.aspose.pdf.Document pdfDocument = new com.aspose.pdf.Document("path_to_your_pdf.pdf");

        // Traverse through pages and annotations
        for (int pageNumber = 1; pageNumber <= pdfDocument.getPages().size(); pageNumber++) {
            com.aspose.pdf.Page pdfPage = pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(pageNumber);

            for (com.aspose.pdf.Annotation annotation : pdfPage.getAnnotations()) {
                // Get annotation position
                double x = annotation.getRect().getLLX();
                double y = annotation.getRect().getLLY();

                System.out.println("Annotation Position on Page " + pageNumber + ": X=" + x + ", Y=" + y);

                // Extract annotation's type-specific information
                if (annotation instanceof com.aspose.pdf.LinkAnnotation) {
                    com.aspose.pdf.LinkAnnotation linkAnnotation = (com.aspose.pdf.LinkAnnotation) annotation;
                    System.out.println("Link: " + linkAnnotation.getAction().getURL());
                } else if (annotation instanceof com.aspose.pdf.TextAnnotation) {
                    com.aspose.pdf.TextAnnotation textAnnotation = (com.aspose.pdf.TextAnnotation) annotation;
                    System.out.println("Text: " + textAnnotation.getContents());
                } else if (annotation instanceof com.aspose.pdf.StampAnnotation) {
                    // Handle stamp annotations
                    // You can extract stamp-specific information here
                }

                // Save annotation resources to a file
                String annotationFileName = "annotation_page_" + pageNumber + "_annotation_" + annotation.getNumber() + ".png";
                if (annotation.getAppearance() != null) {
                    annotation.getAppearance().getImage().save(annotationFileName, ImageFormat.getPng());
                    System.out.println("Annotation resource saved to: " + annotationFileName);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
In this example, replace "path_to_your_pdf.pdf" with the actual path to your PDF file.

The code iterates through each page of the PDF document and extracts annotations using pdfPage.getAnnotations(). For each annotation, it prints the annotation's position on the respective page and then extracts type-specific information such as URLs for link annotations and contents for text annotations. The resources (images) associated with the annotations are extracted and saved to files.

Keep in mind that annotation types and their properties might vary, so this example focuses on common annotation types like links, text, and stamps. If your PDF contains other types of annotations, you might need to extend the code to handle those cases accordingly.

Also, note that the appearance of annotations can be complex, and not all annotations might have associated resources. You might need to consider additional handling for different cases.

lets walk Form Field to print types, placeholders and positions
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's how you can walk through form fields in a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java, extract their types, placeholders, and positions:

java
Copy code
import com.aspose.pdf.*;

public class FormFieldParsingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Load the PDF document
        com.aspose.pdf.Document pdfDocument = new com.aspose.pdf.Document("path_to_your_pdf.pdf");

        // Traverse through form fields
        for (com.aspose.pdf.Page pdfPage : pdfDocument.getPages()) {
            for (com.aspose.pdf.interactivefeatures.forms.Field formField : pdfPage.getForm().getFields()) {
                String fieldType = formField.getFullName();
                String placeholder = formField.getValue();
                Rectangle fieldRectangle = formField.getRectangle();

                System.out.println("Field Type: " + fieldType);
                System.out.println("Placeholder: " + placeholder);
                System.out.println("Field Position: X=" + fieldRectangle.getLLX() + ", Y=" + fieldRectangle.getLLY());

                // Handle different field types (TextBox, CheckBox, RadioButton, etc.)
                if (formField instanceof com.aspose.pdf.interactivefeatures.forms.TextBoxField) {
                    com.aspose.pdf.interactivefeatures.forms.TextBoxField textBoxField = (com.aspose.pdf.interactivefeatures.forms.TextBoxField) formField;
                    System.out.println("Max Length: " + textBoxField.getMaxLength());
                    // Handle other TextBox-specific properties
                } else if (formField instanceof com.aspose.pdf.interactivefeatures.forms.CheckBoxField) {
                    com.aspose.pdf.interactivefeatures.forms.CheckBoxField checkBoxField = (com.aspose.pdf.interactivefeatures.forms.CheckBoxField) formField;
                    System.out.println("Is Checked: " + checkBoxField.getChecked());
                    // Handle other CheckBox-specific properties
                } else if (formField instanceof com.aspose.pdf.interactivefeatures.forms.RadioButtonField) {
                    com.aspose.pdf.interactivefeatures.forms.RadioButtonField radioButtonField = (com.aspose.pdf.interactivefeatures.forms.RadioButtonField) formField;
                    System.out.println("Is Selected: " + radioButtonField.isSelected());
                    // Handle other RadioButton-specific properties
                }
                // Add more cases for other field types as needed

                System.out.println("----------");
            }
        }
    }
}
In this example, replace "path_to_your_pdf.pdf" with the actual path to your PDF file.

The code iterates through each page of the PDF document and extracts form fields using pdfPage.getForm().getFields(). For each form field, it prints the field type (which is often the field's name), placeholder (value), and position.

The example includes handling for different types of form fields like TextBoxField, CheckBoxField, and RadioButtonField. You can extend the code to handle other field types as needed.

Please note that PDF form fields can have various properties depending on their types, and the code example covers only a few common properties. If your PDF contains more complex form fields or specific properties, you might need to customize the code accordingly.

============


Sure, here's an example of how you can walk through Graph (drawing) elements in a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java and print various information:

java
Copy code
import com.aspose.pdf.*;

public class GraphParsingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Load the PDF document
        com.aspose.pdf.Document pdfDocument = new com.aspose.pdf.Document("path_to_your_pdf.pdf");

        // Traverse through pages and graph elements
        for (int pageNumber = 1; pageNumber <= pdfDocument.getPages().size(); pageNumber++) {
            com.aspose.pdf.Page pdfPage = pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(pageNumber);

            // Extract graph elements using operator collection
            com.aspose.pdf.OperatorCollection operators = pdfPage.getContents();
            for (com.aspose.pdf.Operator op : operators) {
                if (op instanceof com.aspose.pdf.operators.GSave) {
                    // Save graphic state
                    System.out.println("Graphic State Save");
                } else if (op instanceof com.aspose.pdf.operators.GRestore) {
                    // Restore graphic state
                    System.out.println("Graphic State Restore");
                } else if (op instanceof com.aspose.pdf.operators.ConcatenateMatrix) {
                    com.aspose.pdf.operators.ConcatenateMatrix cmOp = (com.aspose.pdf.operators.ConcatenateMatrix) op;
                    Matrix matrix = cmOp.getMatrix();
                    System.out.println("Concatenate Matrix: " + matrix.toString());
                } else if (op instanceof com.aspose.pdf.operators.MoveTo) {
                    com.aspose.pdf.operators.MoveTo moveToOp = (com.aspose.pdf.operators.MoveTo) op;
                    System.out.println("MoveTo: X=" + moveToOp.getX() + ", Y=" + moveToOp.getY());
                }
                // Handle more graph operators as needed
            }
        }
    }
}
In this example, replace "path_to_your_pdf.pdf" with the actual path to your PDF file.

The code iterates through each page of the PDF document and extracts graph elements using the OperatorCollection obtained from pdfPage.getContents(). It then processes various graph operators, such as GSave (saving graphic state), GRestore (restoring graphic state), ConcatenateMatrix (transformations), MoveTo (starting a new path), etc. The example covers only a subset of possible graph operators.

Please note that working with graph elements in a PDF document is more complex and low-level compared to text, images, or annotations. The example provides a starting point, but you might need to delve deeper into PDF graphics and operators to extract more specific information about path data, shapes, and transformations.

For comprehensive information about graph operators, their usage, and what they represent in PDF, you may refer to the official Aspose.PDF documentation and other resources about PDF graphics operators and the PDF specification itself.


In PDF documents, graphical operations and transformations are represented using a sequence of operators that manipulate the graphics state and control the rendering of content on the page. These operators are fundamental building blocks for drawing and rendering graphics in PDF.

Here are explanations for the operators you mentioned:

Operator:
In the context of Aspose.PDF for Java, an operator represents a single instruction or command that is part of a sequence of operations used to draw graphics on a PDF page. Each operator typically performs a specific action such as drawing a path, setting colors, managing text, etc.

GRestore:
The GRestore operator is used to restore the graphics state to a previously saved state. It undoes any changes made by the GSave operator, effectively reverting the graphics state back to what it was when the GSave was invoked. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the graphics state stack when multiple operations are performed.

ConcatenateMatrix:
The ConcatenateMatrix operator is used to apply a transformation matrix to the current graphics state. This matrix can be used to translate, rotate, scale, or skew graphical content. By concatenating transformation matrices, you can achieve complex transformations of graphical elements.

MoveTo:
The MoveTo operator is used to begin a new path or subpath by moving the current point (the "pen") to a specific location in the graphics coordinate system. This command establishes a starting point for drawing paths and shapes. Other operations can then be used to draw lines, curves, and other graphical elements starting from this point.

These operators are part of the PDF graphics state and path construction machinery, and they are used to build complex graphics on a PDF page. Aspose.PDF provides classes and interfaces to represent these operators in its API, allowing you to manipulate and analyze the graphical content of a PDF document programmatically. However, working with these low-level graphics operators often requires a deep understanding of the PDF specification and the intricacies of graphics programming.


Operators in a PDF content stream are represented by their respective operator classes in Aspose.PDF for Java. However, there isn't a unified set of properties that can be extracted from all operators because each operator type may have its own specific properties.

Since operators have varying purposes and characteristics, you typically need to interact with the properties that are specific to the operator type you're dealing with. Here's an example of how you might print properties for a few specific operator types:

java
Copy code
import com.aspose.pdf.*;

public class OperatorPropertiesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Load the PDF document
        com.aspose.pdf.Document pdfDocument = new com.aspose.pdf.Document("path_to_your_pdf.pdf");

        // Traverse through pages and operators
        for (int pageNumber = 1; pageNumber <= pdfDocument.getPages().size(); pageNumber++) {
            com.aspose.pdf.Page pdfPage = pdfDocument.getPages().get_Item(pageNumber);

            // Extract operators using operator collection
            com.aspose.pdf.OperatorCollection operators = pdfPage.getContents();
            for (com.aspose.pdf.Operator op : operators) {
                // Handle specific operator types
                if (op instanceof com.aspose.pdf.operators.GSave) {
                    System.out.println("Operator: GSave");
                } else if (op instanceof com.aspose.pdf.operators.GRestore) {
                    System.out.println("Operator: GRestore");
                } else if (op instanceof com.aspose.pdf.operators.ConcatenateMatrix) {
                    com.aspose.pdf.operators.ConcatenateMatrix cmOp = (com.aspose.pdf.operators.ConcatenateMatrix) op;
                    Matrix matrix = cmOp.getMatrix();
                    System.out.println("Operator: ConcatenateMatrix");
                    System.out.println("Matrix: " + matrix.toString());
                } else if (op instanceof com.aspose.pdf.operators.MoveTo) {
                    com.aspose.pdf.operators.MoveTo moveToOp = (com.aspose.pdf.operators.MoveTo) op;
                    System.out.println("Operator: MoveTo");
                    System.out.println("X: " + moveToOp.getX());
                    System.out.println("Y: " + moveToOp.getY());
                }
                // Handle more operators as needed
            }
        }
    }
}
In this example, the code iterates through each operator on each page of the PDF document and prints information specific to each operator type. Since operators can have diverse functionality, there's no single set of properties that applies to all operators.

Remember that working with PDF operators often requires a deep understanding of the PDF specification and graphics programming concepts. The example provided offers a basic starting point, but you might need to consult the PDF specification and Aspose.PDF documentation for detailed information on each operator type.


what is GSave?
ChatGPT
In PDF graphics programming, the GSave operator (short for "Graphics Save") is used to save the current graphics state onto a stack. This allows you to preserve the current settings and attributes of the graphics state before making changes, such as transformations, color settings, and clipping paths.

The GSave operator is typically used in conjunction with the GRestore operator (short for "Graphics Restore"). After you have modified the graphics state, you can use the GRestore operator to revert to the previously saved state. This is important because it helps to isolate the effects of one part of your drawing operations from affecting other parts.

Here's how the GSave operator is used in a PDF content stream:

You use the GSave operator to save the current graphics state onto a stack. The current graphics state includes information like transformation matrix, colors, line settings, clipping paths, etc.

You perform the desired graphical operations that modify the graphics state.

You use the GRestore operator to restore the graphics state to what it was when the GSave operator was invoked.

This mechanism allows you to manage complex graphical operations without affecting the state of the drawing canvas. It's particularly useful when you need to apply transformations, like translations or rotations, to only certain portions of the graphics.

In Aspose.PDF for Java, the GSave and GRestore operators are represented respectively by the classes com.aspose.pdf.operators.GSave and com.aspose.pdf.operators.GRestore. You can use these classes to interact with these operators in the context of PDF graphics programming.

At last but not least, wallk through Outline Items
ChatGPT
Certainly! Outline items in a PDF document are often referred to as bookmarks. They provide a navigational aid, allowing users to quickly jump to specific sections or pages within the document. Here's how you can walk through outline items (bookmarks) in a PDF document using Aspose.PDF for Java and print their titles, target pages, and other properties:

java
Copy code
import com.aspose.pdf.*;

public class OutlineItemParsingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Load the PDF document
        com.aspose.pdf.Document pdfDocument = new com.aspose.pdf.Document("path_to_your_pdf.pdf");

        // Get the outline collection
        OutlineItemCollection outlineItems = pdfDocument.getOutlines().get_Item(1);

        // Walk through outline items
        walkOutlineItems(outlineItems, "");
    }

    public static void walkOutlineItems(OutlineItemCollection outlineItems, String indent) {
        for (com.aspose.pdf.OutlineItem outlineItem : outlineItems) {
            System.out.println(indent + "Title: " + outlineItem.getTitle());
            System.out.println(indent + "Destination Page: " + outlineItem.getDestination().getPageNumber());
            System.out.println(indent + "Destination Type: " + outlineItem.getDestination().getType());

            // Recursively walk through child outline items
            if (outlineItem.getSubItems() != null && outlineItem.getSubItems().size() > 0) {
                walkOutlineItems(outlineItem.getSubItems(), indent + "  ");
            }
        }
    }
}
Replace "path_to_your_pdf.pdf" with the actual path to your PDF file.

In this example, we first load the PDF document. Then, we retrieve the outline items (bookmarks) using pdfDocument.getOutlines().get_Item(1), assuming that the bookmarks are located at the root level (level 1). The method walkOutlineItems is then called to recursively traverse and print the outline item details.

For each outline item, the example prints its title, target page number, and destination type. If the outline item has sub-items (child bookmarks), it recursively walks through them as well, applying an indentation to represent the hierarchy.

Please note that outline items (bookmarks) can have varying structures, and the example assumes a relatively simple scenario. If your PDF contains more complex outline hierarchies or additional properties, you might need to adapt the code to handle those cases accordingly.
